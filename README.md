# Densworld Courses

*The Archives of the Capital contain testimony from a world that should not exist. The creatures of Yeller Quarry have killed named individuals whose deaths are recorded in expedition logs. The Colonel spent twenty years besieging a tower that hovers above the ground. Three children went missing in the quarry, and the data to find them is waiting for someone who knows pandas.*

**These are data science and machine learning courses built on fiction.**

## The Idea

I've spent years developing a fictional world—~70,000 lines of narrative across twelve interconnected archives. From this fiction, I extract structured datasets: creature catalogs, scholarly manuscripts, expedition logs, behavioral observations, spatial surveys.

Students learn real technical skills by analyzing data that exists nowhere else. They can't copy answers from Stack Overflow. They can't find solutions on Kaggle. The only way through is to actually learn.

**The fiction is the ore. The structured data is the refined metal.**

## What This Becomes

The curriculum spans foundations through advanced AI/ML:

- **Python and pandas** through creature trapping records
- **NLP and text analysis** through philosophical manuscripts and forgery detection
- **Time series and anomaly detection** through behavioral observation logs
- **Hugging Face infrastructure** through a seven-course journey to building domain-specific models
- **Spatial analysis and hypothesis testing** through a world where boundaries shift and coordinates curve
- **Pattern recognition and formal languages** through jigsaw puzzles and invented notation systems

Each course uses narrative framing to create stakes. You're not cleaning a CSV—you're an apprentice archivist, and your mistakes have consequences within the fiction.
