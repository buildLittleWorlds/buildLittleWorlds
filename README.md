# Densworld Courses

**Learn data science, machine learning, and AI through a fictional world you can't cheat.**

I'm Daniel Plate. AI researcher, applied AI professor, and creative writer at [Lindenwood University](https://www.lindenwood.edu/). I hold a Ph.D. in Literature (Washington University in St. Louis), an M.A. in Human-Centered AI (Lindenwood), and an M.F.A. in Creative Writing (University of Arkansas). My research focuses on AI integration in humanities education, and I've published multiple books and peer-reviewed articles on the subject.

These courses teach real, transferable technical skills using synthetic datasets extracted from a ~70,000-line fictional archive I've developed over many years. Students can't copy answers from Stack Overflow because no one else has ever analyzed Yeller Quarry trap records or Capital Archives manuscripts. **You have to actually learn.**

## Where to Start

### Absolute Beginners
**[Gateway to Densworld](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/gateway-to-densworld)** (10 tutorials)
New to Python or Google Colab? Start here. You'll learn notebook fundamentals—running cells, variables, loops, functions, pandas—by exploring the fictional world region by region. No prerequisites.

### Know Python, Want Data Science
**[Yeller Quarry Data Science](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/yeller-quarry-data-science)** (10 tutorials)
Learn pandas by investigating creature sightings, trap deployments, and—eventually—three missing children.

### Know Python, Want Modern AI/ML
**[The Archivist's Inference Engine](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/archivist-inference-engine)** (10 tutorials)
Become an "inference clerk" in the Capital Archives, learning to use Hugging Face transformers for real NLP tasks.

### Interested in How the Data Was Created?
**[The Noise and the Signal](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/noise-and-signal)** (11+ tutorials, 3 tracks)
Learn the methodology behind all these courses—extracting structured datasets from messy, narrative text.

### Puzzle Series (2 Courses)

Pattern recognition and formal language design through jigsaw puzzles and constructed languages.

| # | Course | What You'll Learn | Tutorials |

---

### Spatial Series (5 Courses)

Explore Densworld's alternative spatial physics through data analysis. The series builds toward a "fourth-wall break" where students discover that the fictional concepts map to real mathematics, physics, and philosophy.

| # | Course | What You'll Learn | Tutorials |
|---|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1 | [The Surveyor's Art](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/surveyors-art) | Time series analysis, hypothesis testing | 6 |
| 2 | [The Cartographer's Dilemma](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/02-cartographers-dilemma) | Coordinate systems, observer effects | 6 |

| 4 | [The Senator's Question](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/04-senators-question) | Policy analysis, text mining, institutional dynamics | 6 |
| 5 | [The Translation](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/the-translation) | Philosophy of space, foundations of mathematics | 6 |

**The reveal:** By Course 5, students discover they've been learning real frameworks all along—quantum measurement, dynamical systems, process philosophy, non-Euclidean geometry—through the lens of fiction.

## About These Courses

Every course uses **narrative framing** to create stakes. You're not just cleaning a CSV—you're an apprentice archivist whose mistakes "have gotten trappers killed." Technical concepts get semantic anchors: gradient descent becomes The Colonel's 20-year siege; dot products measure similarity between philosophical schools.

All notebooks run in Google Colab with one click. No local setup required.
