# Densworld Courses

**Learn data science, machine learning, and AI through a fictional world you can't cheat on.**

I'm Daniel Plate—AI researcher, applied AI professor, and creative writer at [Lindenwood University](https://www.lindenwood.edu/). I hold a Ph.D. in Literature (Washington University in St. Louis), an M.A. in Human-Centered AI (Lindenwood), and an M.F.A. in Creative Writing (University of Arkansas). My research focuses on AI integration in humanities education, and I've published multiple books and peer-reviewed articles on the subject.

These courses teach real, transferable technical skills using synthetic datasets extracted from a ~70,000-line fictional archive I've developed over many years. Students can't copy answers from Stack Overflow because no one else has ever analyzed Yeller Quarry trap records or Capital Archives manuscripts. **You have to actually learn.**

## Two Learning Paths

### Foundational Data Science & ML

Start here if you're new to Python, data science, or machine learning. Each course is self-contained.

| Course | What You'll Learn | Tutorials |

| [Capital Archives NLP](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/capital-archives-nlp) | Natural language processing, text analysis, stylometry | 10 |
| [ML Math with Densworld](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/ml-math-with-densworld) | Statistics, linear algebra, calculus for ML | 4 modules |
| [Journeys and Graphs](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/journeys-and-graphs) | Graph theory, network analysis | 6 |
| [Densmok CC Analytics](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/densmok-cc-analytics) | Time series, anomaly detection, survival analysis | 5 |
| [Densworld API Course](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/densworld-api-course) | FastAPI, REST APIs, databases, authentication | 9 |

### Hugging Face AI/ML Series

A sequential seven-course journey through modern AI infrastructure, culminating in a fine-tuned domain-specific language model. **Take these in order.**

| # | Course | What You'll Build | Tutorials |
|---|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1 | [The Archivist's Inference Engine](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/archivist-inference-engine) | Use pre-trained models for classification, NER, summarization, Q&A | 10 |
| 2 | [The Expedition Cartographer's Workshop](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/expedition-cartographer-workshop) | Embeddings, vector databases (FAISS), semantic search | 10 |
| 3 | [The Space Builders of Mirado](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/space-builders-mirado) | Gradio interfaces, HF Spaces deployment | 8 |
| 4 | [The Forge at Yeller Quarry](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/forge-yeller-quarry) | Fine-tune language models with LoRA/PEFT | 13 |
| 5 | [The Densworld Oracle](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/densworld-oracle) | RAG pipelines with LlamaIndex, domain-specific LLM | 10 |
| 6 | [The Wanderer's Experiments](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/wanderer-experiments) | Model evaluation, benchmarking, adapting to new releases | 8 |
| Meta | [The Noise and the Signal](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/noise-and-signal) | Extract structured data from messy text (3 tracks) | 11+ |

## Where to Start

**New to programming or data science?**
Start with [Yeller Quarry Data Science](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/yeller-quarry-data-science). You'll learn pandas by investigating creature sightings, trap deployments, and—eventually—three missing children.

**Know Python, want to learn modern AI/ML?**
Start with [The Archivist's Inference Engine](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/archivist-inference-engine). You'll become an "inference clerk" in the Capital Archives, learning to use Hugging Face transformers for real NLP tasks.

**Interested in how the data was created?**
[The Noise and the Signal](https://github.com/buildLittleWorlds/noise-and-signal) teaches the methodology behind all these courses—how to extract structured datasets from messy, narrative text.

## About These Courses

Every course uses **narrative framing** to create stakes. You're not just cleaning a CSV—you're an apprentice archivist whose mistakes "have gotten trappers killed." Technical concepts get semantic anchors: gradient descent becomes The Colonel's 20-year siege; dot products measure similarity between philosophical schools.

All notebooks run in Google Colab with one click. No local setup required.

## About Me

I research and publish on AI integration in humanities education. Recent work includes:

- *Beyond Code: Redefining Programming Education Beyond STEM* (CRC Press/Routledge, 2025)
- *The Case Against Disclosure: Defending Creative Autonomy in the Age of AI* (Common Ground, 2025)
- *Mind, Machine, and Will: Determinism, Responsibility, and Agency in the Age of AI* (Nova Science, 2025)
- *Generative AI in the English Composition Classroom* (Routledge, 2024)

I teach applied AI courses in Lindenwood's Human-Centered AI program and have 20+ years of experience teaching writing, literature, and world-building.
